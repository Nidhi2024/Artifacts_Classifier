# Artifacts_classification

## Purpose
The Project aims to develop an classifier that can classify Archaeological artifacts based on images.Potentially such techniques can help archaeologist for classification 
of historical artifacts.

## Method
The model is trained on Convolution Neural Network using VGG19 transfer learning by adding the custom output layers on three different categories namely Basket, Coin and Figure.

## Dataset
The Dataset has been taken from sources like kaggle, http://collection-online.moa.ubc.ca/explore and contains 1000 images per class 
in training data and 100 images per class in validation data.

## Model performance
The following model yielded highest accuracy
